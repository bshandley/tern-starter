# TERN Stack Starter
**T** Typescript
**E** Expressjs
**R** Reactjs
**N** NodeJs

I started this stack to facilitate development of React/Typescript frontend with Express/Node backend.

Unlike other implementations, this project has only one webpack.config file and one tsconfig file to ease maintenance.
