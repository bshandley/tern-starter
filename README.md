# TERN Half-Stack Starter
**T** Typescript
**E** Expressjs
**R** Reactjs
**N** NodeJs

React/Typescript frontend with Express/Node backend in a single project.



# Why?
Keeping up with seperate projects for front and backend is tedious, particularly if you're just trying to prototype. 
This stack (hopefully) makes it easy to jump in and start coding, without a lot of overhead.

# Getting Started
Just run
`npm run-script build`
to get started. The node server is app.ts, while the react frontend is index.tsx. All changes are monitored and repackaged on save. Default port for node server is 3000.
